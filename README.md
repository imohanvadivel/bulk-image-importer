- Simply copy and paste your comma-separated URLs into the provided textbox, and click on the "Import Image" button, all the images will be seamlessly imported onto the Figma canvas.

- If your URLs are delimited differently from commas, you have the option to specify a custom delimiter. For instance, you can use "\n" for a newline and "\t" for a tab.

- Additionally, for URLs missing the base URL, you can easily add it using the "Base URL" option.
